# Introduction

Self-contained, complex Web Forms as pure [JavaScript Object Literals](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/object-literal-extensions/).

## Technology

The library is written as Web Components, using pure native [ES6+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) Modules, and has just one dependency: [Lit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit).

TypeScript is used for generating API documentation.

## Features

- Describe multi-page, complex web forms
- Use any HTML/custom element
- Supports HTML5 validation rules and custom validation logic
- Two-way databinding: map controls in a form to a data model and interface with APIs directly as the model changes.
- Powerful Rules engine for Conditional Logic
- Themes
